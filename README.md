# DeviceSample
A collection of examples of querying a Device related web api. Current languages: C# and NodeJS.

This is based on an early working draft of the services and is very likely to change.  It is intended to demonstrate one method of invoking the api, including how to authenticate, as well as how to structure some of the different ways you can filter and search.  All Models were generated using the device swagger spec.
